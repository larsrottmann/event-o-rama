Server part of event-o-rama application, to be deployed to Google AppEngine.

Consists of:
- GWT web interface to collect essential app data
- Amazon EC2 interface to trigger app creation and receive finish notification


Getting Started:
----------------
1.) Create a file war/service.properties with the following content

    auth.user = appmaker
    auth.password = xxxxx
    
    These attributes are the Basic Auth credentials for the App-Maker notification call.
    
2.) Run the shell script 'scripts/get_c2dm_token.sh' to retrieve initial Google Auth Token
    for sending C2DM messages. You will be asked for the 3v3nt0rama user password
    The script stores the token in the file 'war/dataMessagingToken.txt'.


Tests:
------

In order to run the command-line JUnit tests or to execute any other Ant task, create a build.properties file
and ensure it has the paths correctly set for:

# MUST SET THESE PROPERTIES TO POINT TO APPROPRIATE PATHS

# Extracted GWT distribution location
gwt.home=<path_to_gwt_installation>

# App Engine SDK home
appengine.home=<path_to_app_engine_sdk>
